to import json file from commandline

show dbs -> show databases

show collections -> shows tables

db.stats() -> get status of database 

db.dropDatabase() -> to drop database

db.flightData.find({distance:12000}).pretty() -> get all the records where distance=12000

db.flightData.deleteMany({marker:"to delete"}) -> to delete all records where marker="to delete"

db.flightData.deleteMany({}) -> delete all data of flightData database

db.flightData.insertMany([{}, {}, {}]) -> to insert many data. each data in curly braces and separated by comma

db.flightData.find({distance:{$gt:12000}}).pretty() -> to get all records where distance > 12000

db.flightData.find({distance:{$gte:12000}}).pretty() -> to get all records where distance >= 12000

db.flightData.updateOne({"_id" : ObjectId("61bc5acd90c1ba041e2d4827")}, {$set:{delayed: true}}) -> add new data in column having the objectid passed

db.flightData.update({"_id" : ObjectId("61bc5acd90c1ba041e2d4827")}, {delayed: true}) -> it replace the data of that object id with new values if update() is called without $set

db.flightData.replaceOne({ "_id" : ObjectId("61bc5a5490c1ba041e2d4825")}, {     "departureAirport": "LHR",     "arrivalAirport": "TXL",     "aircraft": "Airbus A320",     "distance": 25000,     "intercontinental": true   })
--> to replaceOne data having that object id with new value

db.passangers.find().toArray() -> convert data into array and print all records

db.passangers.find() -> it returns cursor and at time only print 20 records and if type "it" then print next 20 records similarly...

db.passangers.find().forEach((pass)=>{printjson(pass)}) -> using foreach in cursor and print all records

db.flightData.updateMany({}, {$set:{status: {description:"on-time", lastupdate:"one hour ago"} }}) 
-> insert new document inside each document called nested document

db.flightData.find({"status.description":"on-time"}) -> to get records of nested. we use . to get nested records

db.flightData.find({"status.details.responsible":"James"}).pretty()

db.hobbies.insertMany([   {_id: "Dancing", name:"dancing"},   {_id: "Cooking", name:"cooking"},   {_id: "Yoga", name:"yoga"} ], {ordered:false}) -> insert all non duplicate entry 

db.persons.insertOne({name: "king", age:34}, {writeConcern:{w:1,j:true, wtimeout:20}})

db.movies.find({runtime:60}).count() -> count the number of records matched (eq-> equal to)

db.movies.find({runtime:{$ne:60}}).count() -> count the number of records matched (ne-> not equal)

db.movies.find({runtime:{$lte:42}}).count() -> lte-> less than equal to

db.movies.find({runtime:{$gte:42}}).count()

db.movies.find({runtime:{$gt:42}}).count()

db.movies.find({"rating.average":{$gte:9}}).count()

db.movies.findOne({"rating.average":{$gt:7}})

db.movies.find({genres:"Drama"}).count() -> get all reords having drama genre

db.movies.find({genres:["Drama"]}).count() -> get all records having only drama genre

        "summary" : "<p>The first season of <b>The Wire</b> (2002) concentrated on the often-futile efforts of police to infiltrate a West Baltimore drug ring headed by Avon Barksdale and his lieutenant, Stringer Bell. In Seasons Two and Three, as the Barksdale investigation escalated, new storylines involving pressures on the working class and the city's political leadership were introduced. Season Four focused on the stories of several young boys in the public school system, struggling with problems at home and the lure of the corner - set against the rise of a new drug empire in West Baltimore and a new Mayor in City Hall. The fifth and final season of <i>The Wire</i> centers on the media's role in addressing - or failing to address - the fundamental political, economic and social realities depicted over the course of the series, while also resolving storylines of the numerous characters woven throughout the narrative arc of the show.</p>",

With the balance of good and evil on the line‎, <b>Constantine </b>will use his skills to travel the country, find the supernatural terrors that threaten our world and send them back where they belong.

        "summary" : "<p><b>Hawaii Five-0</b> is a contemporary take on the classic series about a new elite federalized task force whose mission is to wipe out the crime that washes up on the Islands' sun-drenched beaches. Detective Steve McGarrett, a decorated Naval officer-turned-cop, returned to Oahu to investigate his father's murder and stayed after Hawaii's former governor persuaded him to head up the new team: his rules, no red tape and full blanket authority to hunt down the biggest \"game\" in town. Joining McGarrett is Detective Danny \"Danno\" Williams, a relocated ex-New Jersey cop - a working man in paradise who prefers skyscrapers to the coastline - but who's committed to keeping the Islands safe for his young daughter; Chin Ho Kelly, an ex-Honolulu police detective and former protégé of McGarrett's father who was wrongly accused of corruption; Dr. Max Bergman, the quirky coroner; Chin's cousin, Kono Kalakaua, a beautiful and fearless native; and Captain Lou Grover, who formerly headed Hawaii's SWAT unit. Joining them is Jerry Ortega, a former classmate of Chin's and the Island's local conspiracy theorist. The state's brash FIVE-0 unit, who may spar and jest among themselves, remain determined to eliminate the seedy elements from the 50th state.</p>",

Dolvett Quince and Jen Widerstrom return to train eight contestant teams of two, all with compelling stories. Seven teams (spouses, parent/adult child, siblings, relatives, best friends) will know each other, but one team will be two strangers - former \"Celebrity Apprentice\" contestant and the original \"Survivor\" winner, Richard Hatch, and 'The Voice' season two semi-finalist Erin Willett. Having both been in the NBC family previously, the two share the same goal as the other 14 contestants - to change their lives and get healthy. The renovated \"Biggest Loser\" gym, featuring a new interior and exterior branded with the new logo, has modernized equipment to help contestants better achieve their fitness goals, including eight high-tech monitors on the walls of each side of the gym that will track contestants' calorie burns as well as heart rates. Half of the gym will be dedicated to Team Dolvett and the other half dedicated to Team Jen. The weigh-in will be very different this season with a new look and double scales, so contestants on opposing teams can weigh-in side by side, making the weigh-in even more compelling to watch. The contestant house is also getting a whole new look for season 17.</p>",

This list of the most vital security issues facing the nation brings with it moral and political judgment calls for Charleston and... her trusted group of brilliant analysts at the agency. Aside from the political minefields she has to walk, Charlie has a close personal relationship with the President because she was once engaged to her son before a tragic terrorist attack took his life. Charlie survived that attack and is now determined to bring the perpetrators to justice. Navigating a complex personal life and a pressure-cooker profession is, of course, a challenge, and Charlie sometimes engages in boundary-pushing behavior to avoid facing her grief.

        "summary" : "<p><b>Vegas</b> is a drama inspired by the true story of former Las Vegas Sheriff Ralph Lamb, a fourth-generation rancher tasked with bringing order to Las Vegas in the 1960s, a gambling and entertainment mecca emerging from the tumbleweeds. Ralph Lamb wants to be left in peace to run his ranch, but Las Vegas is now swelling with outsiders and corruption which are intruding on his simple life. Recalling Lamb's command as a military police officer during World War II, the Mayor appeals to his sense of duty to look into a murder of a casino worker - and so begins Lamb's clash with Vincent Savino, a ruthless Chicago gangster who plans to make Vegas his own. Assisting Lamb in keeping law and order are his two deputies: his diplomatic, even-keeled brother Jack and his charming but impulsive son Dixon. Ambitious Assistant District Attorney Katherine O'Connell, who grew up on the ranch next to the Lambs, also lends a hand in preserving justice. In Vegas, two powerful men - Lamb and Savino - are engaged in a fierce battle for control of the budding oasis, and for both of them, folding is not an option.</p>",
