Creating 'hr' user:
To create the user 'hr' having password hr: create user hr identified by hr;
To connect to 'hr' account: conn hr/hr@xepdb1;
To connect with 'sys': conn sys/sys@xepdb1 as sysdba;
To give the permission of creating session to 'hr' (we can only grant permission from sys user): grant create session to hr;
To connect with 'hr': conn hr/hr@xepdb1;


How to create a table?
create table test(id numeric(2),name varchar2(10));
It will give below error because initially hr account doesn't have any permission:
create table test(id numeric(2),name varchar2(10))
*
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-01031: insufficient privileges

To give permission to hr account, login to sys and give permission
conn sys/sys@xepdb1 as sysdba;

Give permission of creating table to 'hr': grant create table to hr;
To connect with 'hr': conn hr/hr@xepdb1;


create table test(id numeric(2),name varchar2(10));
Now the table 'test' will be created in the database of 'hr' user.

insert into test values(1,'james');
It will give the error again becuse now the user doesn't have space to store data:
insert into test values(1,'james')
            *
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-01950: no privileges on tablespace 'USERS'

Connect with 'sys' to allocate tablespace to 'hr'.
conn sys/sys@xepdb1 as sysdba

Allocate tablespaces of 10mb on USERS tablespace to 'hr': alter user hr quota 10m on users;

Connect with 'hr': conn hr/hr@xepdb1;


insert into test values(1,'james');
It will create a row in the 'test' table.

Creating user with all the required permissions:
create user hr identified by hr quota 10m on users;
To create user 'hr' and allocate it 10mb tablespace on USERS tablespace.

grant create session, create table to hr;
To give the privilege of creating session and creating table to 'hr'.

Creating table:
create table test(id numeric(2),name varchar2(10));

Inserting a row in the table:
insert into test values(1,'james');
